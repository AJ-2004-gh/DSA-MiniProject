# 🗺️ Hospital Navigation System - Integration Complete

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **FastAPI Backend Created** (`backend/navigation_api.py`)

Complete REST API for hospital pathfinding using **Dijkstra's algorithm** from the original Python file.

#### Features Implemented:
- ✅ **Graph initialization** from `Hospital_Graph_DSA.py`
- ✅ **Dijkstra's algorithm** - Exact implementation from Python file
- ✅ **11 hospital locations** with proper names and icons
- ✅ **16 bidirectional edges** with real distances in meters
- ✅ **CORS enabled** for React frontend (port 5173)
- ✅ **Pydantic validation** for type-safe requests

#### API Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/locations` | Get all hospital locations |
| POST | `/api/path` | Find shortest path (Dijkstra) |
| GET | `/api/graph/info` | Get graph statistics |
| GET | `/api/connections/{location}` | Get direct connections |
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |

#### Location Codes:
- **PKG** - Parking Garage 🅿️

### 2. **React Frontend Updated** (`src/pages/HospitalNavigation.jsx`)

Completely rewritten to use **only the Python backend** - no frontend Dijkstra implementation!

#### Key Changes:
- ❌ **Removed** hardcoded locations array
- ❌ **Removed** local graph object
- ❌ **Removed** frontend Dijkstra algorithm

- ✅ **Added** success/error toast notifications
- ✅ **Added** calculating animation
- ✅ **Added** reset functionality
- ✅ **Enhanced** path visualization with step numbers
- ✅ **Enhanced** location grid with path highlighting

#### New Features:
1. **Auto-fetch locations** from API on page load
2. **Real-time path calculation** via POST request
3. **Visual feedback** - loading spinner during calculation
4. **Toast notifications** - success (green) and error (red)
5. **Enhanced path display:**
   - Total distance in meters
   - Estimated walking time
   - Step-by-step directions with icons
   - Full location names (not just codes)
   - START/END badges
6. **Interactive map:**
   - Green highlight for starting point
   - Red highlight for destination
   - Blue highlight for path nodes
   - Yellow numbered badges on path
7. **Algorithm information card** explaining Dijkstra's complexity

## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start

**Terminal 1: Navigation API (Port 8001)**
```powershell
cd backend
python navigation_api.py
```

**Terminal 2: React Frontend (Port 5173)**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:5173/navigation**

## 🎮 Using the System

### Step 1: Select Locations
1. Choose **Starting Point** from dropdown (e.g., "Parking Garage")
2. Choose **Destination** from dropdown (e.g., "Emergency Room")

### Step 2: Calculate Path
- Click **"Find Shortest Path"** button
- Backend runs Dijkstra's algorithm
- Results appear in ~100ms

### Step 3: View Results
- **Distance:** Total meters (e.g., "160 meters")
- **Time:** Estimated walk time (e.g., "~2 min")
- **Path:** Step-by-step directions with icons
- **Map:** Visual representation with highlighted route

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Simple Path
**Route:** PKG (Parking) → ME (Main Entrance)
- **Expected Distance:** 100 meters
- **Expected Path:** PKG → ME (direct connection)

### Test 2: Multi-Step Path
**Route:** PKG → LAB
- **Expected:** Multiple steps through connecting locations
- **Algorithm:** Finds optimal route automatically

### Test 3: Long Distance
**Route:** PKG → IWB (Inpatient Ward B)
- **Expected:** Longest path in hospital
- **Shows:** Multiple intermediate stops

## 🔬 Algorithm Details

### Dijkstra's Implementation (Python Backend)

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node):
    # Initialize distances to infinity
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    
    # Min-heap priority queue
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]
    previous_nodes = {}
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # Skip if already processed
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        # Found destination
        if current_node == end_node:
            break
        
        # Update neighbor distances
        for neighbor, weight in graph.get(current_node, []):
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    # Reconstruct path
    path = []
    current = end_node
    while current in previous_nodes:
        path.insert(0, current)
        current = previous_nodes[current]
    
    if path:
        path.insert(0, start_node)
    
    return distances[end_node], path
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V)
  - V = number of vertices (11 locations)
  - E = number of edges (16 connections)
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)
  - Stores distances and previous nodes for all vertices

- **Why Min-Heap?**
  - Efficiently finds minimum distance node: O(log V)
  - Better than linear search: O(V)

## 📊 API Examples

### Get All Locations
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/locations
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "PKG",
    "name": "Parking Garage",
    "icon": "🅿️",
    "fullName": "Parking Garage"
  },
  {
    "id": "ER",
    "name": "Emergency Room",
    "icon": "🚑",
    "fullName": "Emergency Room"
  }
  // ... 9 more locations
]
```

### Find Shortest Path
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/path \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"start": "PKG", "end": "ER"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "distance": 160,
  "path": ["PKG", "ME", "IWA", "SUR", "ER"],
  "pathNames": ["Parking Garage", "Main Entrance", "Inpatient Ward A", "Surgical Center", "Emergency Room"],
  "valid": true,
  "estimatedTime": 2
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to connect to navigation server"
**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/health`
2. Restart navigation API: `cd backend && python navigation_api.py`
3. Verify port 8001 is not blocked

### Error: "No path found"
**Cause:** Locations are not connected in graph
**Solution:** This is expected - some locations don't have direct or indirect paths

### Frontend shows old locations
**Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 🎯 Key Differences from Emergency Triage

| Feature | Emergency Triage | Hospital Navigation |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Port** | 8000 | 8001 |
| **Algorithm** | Min-Heap Priority Queue | Dijkstra's Shortest Path |
| **Data Structure** | Heap for patient queue | Graph with adjacency list |
| **Purpose** | Prioritize patients | Find shortest route |
| **Complexity** | O(log n) insert/delete | O((V+E) log V) pathfinding |
