# Hospital Management System with Data Structures and Algorithms
## Interim Project Report

---

## 1. Introduction

### Brief Background of the Project
This project develops a comprehensive Hospital Management System that integrates multiple healthcare operations including inventory management, doctor appointment scheduling, patient billing, emergency management, and hospital navigation. The system leverages various data structures and algorithms to provide efficient solutions for common hospital administrative challenges.

### Motivation Behind Choosing the Problem
Healthcare systems face numerous operational challenges including:
- Inefficient inventory management leading to medicine shortages or wastage
- Complex appointment scheduling and patient tracking
- Difficulty in hospital navigation for patients and visitors
- Manual billing processes prone to errors
- **Critical emergency triage requiring immediate priority-based patient handling**

These challenges motivated the development of an automated system that can streamline hospital operations while demonstrating practical applications of data structures and algorithms.

### Importance of Data Structures in Solving This Problem
Data structures play a crucial role in this system:
- **Priority Heaps** for emergency patient triage and critical operations
- **Min-Heaps** for finding medicines with nearest expiry dates and lowest stock
- **Max-Heaps** for identifying most frequently demanded medicines
- **Hash Tables/Dictionaries** for fast patient and medicine lookups
- **Graphs** for hospital navigation and shortest path finding
- **JSON structures** for persistent data storage and retrieval

## 2. Problem Statement

### Clear Definition of the Problem
The project addresses the need for an integrated hospital management system that can:
1. Manage medicine inventory with expiry tracking
2. Handle patient billing and frequency analysis
3. Schedule and track doctor appointments
4. **Prioritize emergency patients based on medical severity**
5. Provide optimal navigation within hospital premises

### Scope and Boundaries
**Scope:**

## 6. Approach & Methodology

### High-Level Approach
The system follows a modular architecture with **five** main components:
1. **Inventory Management Module**
2. **Billing and Analytics Module**
3. **Doctor Appointment Module**
4. ****Emergency Management Module**
5. **Hospital Navigation Module**

### Data Structures Employed

3. **Max-Heap**: For identifying most frequently demanded medicines
4. **Hash Tables**: For fast lookups of patients, doctors, and medicines
5. **Graph**: For hospital layout representation and shortest path finding

### Algorithms Used

#### **Emergency Triage Algorithm**
```
function create_patient(name, age, symptom):
    severity = severity_map.get(symptom.lower(), 4)
    arrival_time = global_counter++
    patient = {name, age, symptom}
    return (severity, arrival_time, patient)

function add_patient(queue, patient_tuple):
    heappush(queue, patient_tuple)
    
function treat_next_patient(queue):
    if queue is not empty:
        return heappop(queue)  // Returns highest priority patient
```

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm (Hospital Navigation)
```
function dijkstra(graph, start, end):
    distances = {node: infinity for all nodes}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]
    previous_nodes = {}
    
    while priority_queue is not empty:
        current_distance, current_node = pop minimum from priority_queue
        
        if current_node == end:
            break
            
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node
                push (distance, neighbor) to priority_queue
    
    return reconstruct_path(previous_nodes, start, end)
```

#### Heap Operations (Inventory Management)
```
function get_nearest_expiry():
    min_heap = []
    for each medicine:
        for each serial:
            heappush(min_heap, (expiry_date, medicine, serial))
    return heappop(min_heap)
```

    "cardiac arrest": 1, "unconscious": 1, "severe bleeding": 1,
    
    # SERIOUS (Priority 2) - Urgent care needed
    "fracture": 2, "high fever": 2, "severe pain": 2,
    
    # MODERATE (Priority 3) - Stable but needs attention
    "food poisoning": 3, "minor injury": 3, "asthma": 3,
